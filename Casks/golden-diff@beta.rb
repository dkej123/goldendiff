  caveats <<~EOS
    This cask follows the Golden Diff beta channel.

    Golden Diff is currently ad-hoc signed and not notarized. Homebrew verifies the release checksum,
    but Gatekeeper still quarantines the app. If you trust this repository, run after installation:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Golden Diff.app"

    Why this is needed:
